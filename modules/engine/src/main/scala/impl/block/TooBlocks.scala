 * distribute the time across all elements, but the lack of remaining time in
 * any element cannot prevent the scheduling of a ToO observation.
 *
 * <p>We try to split the time evenly, but any element that cannot hold
 * its share of the ToO observation is simply filled to the max and the left
 * over time is spread across the remaining bins.
